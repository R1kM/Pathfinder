The OCaml API for Z3 was tested using OCaml 3.12.1.
You also need CamlIDL to be able to generate the OCaml API.

- To download OCaml:
  http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/      

- To download CamlIDL:
  http://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/camlidl/

- To build the OCaml API for Z3:
  ./build-lib.sh

Remark: The OCaml and C compiler tool chains must be configured in your environment.

Remark: Building the OCaml API copies some pathnames into files,
so the OCaml API must be recompiled if the Z3 library files are moved.

See ../examples/ocaml/build-test.sh for an example of how to compile and link with Z3.

The OCaml interface for Z3 was written by Josh Berdine and Jakob Lichtenberg. 
Many thanks to them!
