This directory contains scripts to build the test application using
OCaml. You also need CamlIDL to be able to generate the OCaml API.

- To download OCaml:
  http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/      

- To download CamlIDL:
  http://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/camlidl/

- One must build the OCaml library before compiling the example.
  Go to directory ../ocaml

- Use 'build-test.sh' to build the test application using the OCaml compiler.

Remark: The OCaml and C compiler tool chains must be configured in your environment.
  
- Use 'exec.sh' to execute test_mlapi. The script sets DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH, and invokes test_mlapi.
