The following is a valid Z3 program, that is sat, and gives some results with the get-model command
We have an array a1, whose length is 2, and a1[x] = 2, a1[y]=3. 
We have to add the two constraints on the indices x and y to have a bounded array


(declare-const x Int)
(declare-const y Int)
(declare-const length Int)
(declare-const a1 (Array Int Int))
(assert (= (select a1 y) 3))
(assert (= (select a1 x) 2))
(assert (< x length))
(assert (< y length))
(assert (>= x 0))
(assert (>= y 0))
(assert (= length 2))
(check-sat)
(get-model)
